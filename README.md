# Stock-Management-System

# **Web Development Intern**
 Interned at Shivaji University Kolhapur, as Web Developer in front-end development and
designed an intuitive user-interface for Stock Management System which helps to track all
the items such as furniture, computers, other small equipment etc. using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap5, Asp.Net.

One of the significant achievements of this project was the successful transition of Shivaji
University from manual stock registers to a digital inventory management system. By
implementing the website, we simplified the process of managing inventory while
eliminating the possibility of stock specification duplication.

This digitized solution allowed for easier addition of new entries and efficient updating of
existing records. Notably, the system enabled effortless access and management of records
dating back to 1962, improving the overall inventory management efficiency of Shivaji
University.
