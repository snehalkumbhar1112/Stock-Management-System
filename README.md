# Stock-Management-System
Problem -
The University's stock tracking system was outdated, leading to inefficiencies in managing various items such as furniture, computers, and small equipment. The existing system lacked a user-friendly interface, making it challenging for staff to efficiently track and manage the university's assets. ...

Solution:
As a web developer intern, I took on the challenge of revamping the Stock Management System. Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap5, and ASP.NET, I focused on creating an intuitive user interface that would streamline the tracking process. The goal was to develop a responsive and visually appealing front-end that could enhance the overall user experience.

Impact:
The revamped Stock Management System significantly improved the efficiency of stock verification and tracking processes across the University. The intuitive design I implemented made it easier for staff to navigate and manage inventory. The system's responsiveness, coupled with Bootstrap5's mobile-friendly features, ensured accessibility from various devices, further increasing its usability. As a result, the university experienced a more streamlined and accurate stock management process, reducing errors and saving valuable time for staff involved in asset tracking. The success of this project showcased my ability to not only contribute to web development but also to address real-world problems through thoughtful design and implementation.
